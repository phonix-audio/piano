//! Aurora impulse-response library for convolution reverb — v4 Phase 4.
//!
//! Like `samples.rs`, IRs here are procedurally rendered at engine init
//! rather than included via `include_bytes!`. The convolution
//! algorithm treats the IR as opaque float data, so swapping in
//! recorded IRs later is just a matter of loading the WAV into the
//! same `ImpulseResponse` shape.
//!
//! Generated IR character:
//! - Sparse early reflections (Gaussian distribution) per channel
//! - Diffuse late tail (exponentially decaying filtered noise)
//! - Per-channel decorrelation to keep stereo width
//! - HF damping shelf inside the tail decay so the response doesn't
//!   read as bright/papery
//!
//! Algorithmic IRs are NOT the same as recorded cathedral IRs — the
//! room modes / clustered reflections of a real space aren't faked
//! here. But this gives a substantially deeper / more "real space"
//! sound than Schroeder algorithmic reverb, and matches the
//! convolution pipeline so a real IR can be dropped in later.
