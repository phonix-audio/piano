//! The editor layer: the design system as a value (`theme`), the widgets,
//! icons, the piano keyboard, the preset picker and its on-disk dialogs,
//! the plugin window's chrome, and, behind `ui-spec`, the declarative
//! layout renderer. Nothing here knows an engine, a patch type or a host:
//! widgets take values and return events.
